        and social media. The school had a strict dress code in which included the way that the student should wear their hair, in which it
        specifically stated "no student is allowed to have dyed hair or anything that can cause a distraction" in which caused a controversy, where
        people had opinions agaisnt or for the decision wether she was going to be allowed to continue to study at the Academy. This issue is still
        going on, the debate of wether it is appropriate for girls or even guys to wear their natural hair on a workplace or is considered unprofessional
        to wear in professional environments. She pursued wearing her hair naturally and embraced it.</h4></P>
